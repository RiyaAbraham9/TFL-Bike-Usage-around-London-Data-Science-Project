# TFL-Bike-Usage-around-London-Data-Science-Project
This project analyses TfL cycling volume data from three selected monitoring sites across London to investigate usage patterns and suggest possible peak charging periods.
The analysis follows a structured, step-by-step approach, from data aggregation to visualisation and machine learning modelling using a Decision Tree Regressor. The results aim to answer the question:
"If TfL were to introduce a charging regime for peak cycle traffic, when should it apply?"

## Objectives
- Aggregate TfL cycle traffic data for three specific monitoring sites.
- Explore traffic patterns by time of day and overall trends.
- Calculate average usage per timeslot to simplify visual interpretation.
- Apply machine learning to identify potential peak periods for charging.
- Assess whether the results could realistically inform a TfL charging policy.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualisation
- TfL Excel/CSV datasets for real-time and historical bike usage
- Git & GitHub for version control

## Dataset
Data Sourced from (Transport for London open data)[https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/]
