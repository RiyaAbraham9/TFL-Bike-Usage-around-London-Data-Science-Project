# TFL-Bike-Usage-around-London-Data-Science-Project
This project analyses real-world Transport for London (TfL) bike usage data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into cycling activity across London. Using data science techniques, we explore temporal usage patterns, popular docking stations, and factors influencing demand.

The goal is to showcase data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualisation, and modelling skills using a real-world public dataset.

## Objectives
- Understand how and when Londoners use TfL bikes.
- Identify peak hours, high-demand locations, and seasonal variations.
- Create data visualisations to make patterns easy to understand.
- Build simple predictive models to forecast bike demand.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualisation
- TfL Excel/CSV datasets for real-time and historical bike usage
- Git & GitHub for version control

## Dataset
Data Sourced from (Transport for London open data)[https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/]
